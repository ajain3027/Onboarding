# Onboarding

# A/B Testing
- Creating two versions of a page - the original (control or A) and a modified version (variation or B) 
- Randomly splitting your traffic between these versions 
- Measuring user engagement through a dashboard 
- Analyzing results to determine if the changes had positive, negative, or neutral effects

# Why do we create experiments or do A/B Testing? How does it help in increasing revenue?
You can improve your landing pages by testing changes to headlines, form fields, and CTAs. By testing one element at a time, you can identify which changes increase lead quality and conversion rates.
