# Onboarding

A/B Testing
- Creating two versions of a page - the original (control or A) and a modified version (variation or B) 
- Randomly splitting your traffic between these versions 
- Measuring user engagement through a dashboard 
- Analyzing results to determine if the changes had positive, negative, or neutral effects
